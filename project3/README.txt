Description
    This project is to be completed on your own. You will implement a program involving tree
traversal(s) to compute the packing of rectangles, represented by a binary tree.
    In this binary tree, each leaf node represents a rectangle. Each internal node of the binary tree
represents a partitioning of two groups of rectangles by a horizontal cutline or a vertical cutline.
Let xHy (xVy) denote a (sub)tree, whose root node is a horizonal cut H (a vertical cut V). The left
and right subtrees of H (V) are x and y, respectively. Assume that xHy means x is on top of and y
is below the horizontal cut, and xVy means x is to the left and y is to the right of the vertical cut.
    In the following figure, we show an example of a "packing" of three rectangles based on a
given binary tree representation. Here, each subtree is enclosed by a smallest rectangular room.
Assume that the dimensions (width, height) of the three rectangles x, y, and z are (3,3), (4,5), and
(7,7). The smallest room containing the subtree yVz is of dimensions (11,7).

                                                         H

                                                                       z
                                                                y

                            y           z
                                                                 V

                      (a) A binary tree            (b) The corresponding packing



    The smallest room containing the subtree xH(yVz) is of dimensions (11,10). This room is
partitioned in to two smaller rooms: The top room is of dimensions (11,3) and it contains rectangle
x, whereas the bottom room is of dimensions (11,7) and it contains rectangles y and z. We place
the lower left corner of each rectangle to the lower left corner of its room.
    Assuming that the lower left corner of the smallest room containing all the blocks is at coordi-
nates (0,0), the coordinates of lower left corners of the three rectangles x, y, and z are respectively
(0,7), (0,0) and (4,0). Note that even though there is space above y to accommodate x, x has to
stay above the horizontal cutline in the packing, as shown in the figure.
    Given a binary tree representation, the smallest rectangular room to enclose all rectangles and
the coordinates of these rectangles in the corresponding packing can be computed in O(n) time
complexity using appropriate tree-traversal algorithm(s).

Deliverables:
    In this project, you are to develop your own include file packing.h and source file packing.c,
which can be compiled with the following command:

    gcc -Werror -Wbad-function-cast -Wall -Wshadow -O3 packing.c -o proj3

    All declarations and definition of data structures and functions must reside in the include file
or source file. The executable proj3 would be invoked as follows:

    proj3 input file output file

    The executable loads the binary tree from input file, performs packing, and saves the pack-
ing into output file.

    Your source code should contain the following three functions (you may also need other func-
tions):

1. Load binary tree from file
    The input filename (including path) is provided in the command line. The binary tree contained
in the file should be read in, parsed, and stored in the tree data structures defined by you. The input
file is divided into two sections. The first section contains information that should help you to
construct your binary tree:

     Number of blocks (int), which specifies the number of rectangles.

     Number of nodes (int), which specifies the number of nodes in the binary tree.

    The second section specifies the topology of the binary tree. Every line contains seven fields:

     thisnode (integer), which specifies the node number of current node.

     parnode (integer), which specifies the node number of the parent of current node. A node
      number of "-1" indicates the absence of a parent node, i.e., the current node is the root node
      of the tree.

     lcnode (integer), which specifies the node number of the left child node. A node number of
      "-1" indicates the absence of a left child node.

     rcnode (integer), which specifies the node number of the right child node. A node number
      of "-1" indicates the absence of a right child node.

     cutline (char), which specifies the orientation of the cutline. For a leaf node, the cutline
      orientation is specified with `-'. For an internal node, we use `H' to denote a horizontal
      cutline and `V' to denote a vertical cutline.

     width (double), the width of the rectangle if the node is a leaf node. We use `-' for an
      internal node.


                                                  2

    height (double), the height of the rectangle if the node is a leaf node. We use `-' for an
      internal node.

   Note that the list of nodes starts with all the sink (leaf) nodes.

2. Perform packing
   Perform packing on the binary tree you have loaded in, using data type double for your com-
putation of coordinates. At the end of the analysis, the program should report the following:


Preorder:


Inorder:


Postorder:


Width:
Height:


X-coordinate:
Y-coordinate:


Elapsed time:


   Here, Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder should print the node numbers as the tree is tra-
versed in preorder, inorder, and postorder fashion. The elapsed time refers to the user time used by
the packing function (see project 1). Please do not include the time it takes to load and save. For
Width and Height, you should report the width and height of the smallest room that encloses the
packing specified by the binary tree. For X-coordinate and Y-coordinate, you should report
the coordinates of the rectangle with the largest node number.

   Note that you do not really pack the rectangles tightly, as shown in Figure (b).

3. Save packing to file
   The output filename (including path) is provided in the command line. The first line should
specify the number of rectangles.

    Number of blocks (int), which specifies the number of rectangles.

Subsequently, the file should contain a line for each rectangle, starting from the lowest indexed
rectanlge: Every line contains five fields:

    thisnode (integer), which specifies the node number of current node.

    width (double), the width of the rectangle.

    height (double), the height of the rectangle.


                                                   3

    xcoord (double), the x-coordinate of the rectangle.

    ycoord (double), the y-coordinate of the rectangle.


   Consider the following input file:


8
15
1 14 -1 -1 - 2 4
2 13 -1 -1 - 1 3
3 10 -1 -1 - 3 3
4 9 -1 -1 - 3 5
5 13 -1 -1 - 3 2
6 11 -1 -1 - 5 3
7 9 -1 -1 - 1 2
8 12 -1 -1 - 2 4
9 10 7 4 V - -
10 11 3 9 H - -
11 12 10 6 V - -
12 15 11 8 V - -
13 14 2 5 V - -
14 15 13 1 H - -
15 -1 14 12 H - -


   The following figure shows the corresponding binary tree and packing. The numbers in paren-
theses besides each internal node denote the width and height of the smallest room enclosing the
rectangles in the subtrees of this node. Therefore, the width and the height of the smallest room
enclosing all rectangles are 11 and 15. The coordinates of the largest indexed node are (9,0).

                                        15(11,15)


                    14(4,7)                   12(11,8)
                                 11(9,8)
                13(4,3)
                             10(4,8)




                                         9(4,5)




   The output file should have the following format:


                                                 4

    The screen dump should show the following:

Inorder:     2 13 5 14 1 15 3 10 7 9 4 11 6 12 8

X-coordinate:       9.000000e+00
Y-coordinate:       0.000000e+00


Elapsed Time:       0.000000e+00


Grading:
    The project requires the submission (through Blackboard) of the C-code (source and include
files) and a report detailing the results. There should a table listing the run-times, and the outputs
of the packing (width, height, and x- and y-coordinates of the largest indexed rectangles) obtained
from running your code on some sample input files. In your report, also comment on the run-time
and space complexity of your algorithm. Your report should not be longer than 1 page and should
be in plain text format or pdf.

Getting started:
    We provide sample input files for you to evaluate the run-times of your packing program. We
also provide the sample output and the screen output for the 8-rectangle example: r6.pck and
r6.log, respectively. The input of this example is r6 flr.txt. Copy over the files from the
Blackboard website. Check out the Blackboard website for any updates to these instructions. Start
packing!
